Hi. I’m Mark.

I work and live in Cork, Ireland.

I’ve been working in software for over 10 years. After a varied career (QA, development, automation, build, localization), I moved into a full time, full-stack, dev role in early 2016. This job consisted of both back (C#, MS stack) and front-end (JavaScript) development. As much as I enjoy the challenges of creating enterprise level web service applications, it is the front-end role which interests me most.

Since I began working on front-end technologies I have enjoyed this tech more than any other. It is an exciting, challenging and fast evolving part of software and one that I’m delighted to be part of.
